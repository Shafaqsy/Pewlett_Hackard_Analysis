## Summary
1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?.

There are 90,398 employes are retiring and that's a huge number. The company needs to hire people urgently. 90,398 roles  need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring.

2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

I don't think there's enough employees to mentor the next generation because  we only have 1,550 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
